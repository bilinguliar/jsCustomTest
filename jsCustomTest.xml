                remember that they must be very soft and unobtrusive. Only you and people close to you should be aware

                    <shortDescription>Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as
                        GC/MS can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS
                        analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients.

                    <shortDescription>This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other
                        ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS
                        equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal
                        about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more
                        or less precisely."

                    <shortDescription>Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult
                        due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown
                        of the odorous compounds.

                        chromatograph (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both
                        through their physical properties and their scent.

                        market.

                        areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on
                        human health and the environment.

                        personal cleaning products. Due to their large scale use, several types of synthetic musks have
                        been found in human fat and milk.

                    <shortDescription>Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full
                        listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005,
                        the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced.

                        storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma
                        intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.

                        degrees Celsius (37-45 degrees Fahrenheit).

                        quality of a perfume.

                    <shortDescription>Aromatherapy may have origins in antiquity with the use of infused aromatic oils,
                        made by macerating dried plant material in fatty oil, heating and then filtering. Many such oils
                        are described by Dioscorides, along with beliefs of the time regarding their healing properties,
                        in his De Materia Medica, written in the first century.

                        describe fragrant oils extracted from plant material by any solvent extraction.
